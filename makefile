# Build instructions for date-progress.
#
# This file governs the build process for date-progress, basically just consists of downloading the single dependency
# (bootstrap) and zipping up all the necessary files.  It feels a bit silly to have a makefile for this, but it's just
# barely complex enough that simply zipping up the source tree doesn't quite cut it, and this is nicer than a shell
# script.
